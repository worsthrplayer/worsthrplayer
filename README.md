- Hey all, I'm worsthrplayer. You might recognise me from the game "osu!". This is not the actual worsthrplayer, its just a joke account
- I reside in Sydney, Australia.
- No, I don't ride kangaroos, but the spiders are huge and no, I don't eat a jar of vegemite daily, and theres no "shrimp on the barbie" bullshit around here, we call them prawns.
- I'll be sharing scripts on my main profile. All of it is free to use and always will be.
- I will allow anyone to commit to my projects and repositories. I like recieving constructive critism and always would appreciate feedback.
- I have had a decent amount of programming experience in the past. Although I'm not the best, I'll always try to contribute as much as possible.
- My current goal is to hit a grade of a C on GitHub. I know it will take a long time but I'll get there eventually and I am happy to share my journey with everyone along the way.
- worsthrplayer out.
