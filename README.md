- Hey all, I'm worsthrplayer. You might recognise me from the game "osu!". This is not the actual worsthrplayer, its just a joke account. 
- I'll be sharing scripts on my main profile. All of it is free to use and always will be. 
- I have had a decent amount of programming experience in the past, although I'm not the best, I'll always try to contribute as much as possible.
- My current goal is to hit a grade of B- on GitHub. I know it will take a long time but I'll get there eventually and I am happy to share my journey with everyone along the way.
- I reside in Sydney, Australia.
- worsthrplayer out.
